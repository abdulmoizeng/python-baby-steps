This app uses Flask as a framework to implement some basic templating with jinja.

It fetches the template from the templates/ folder and implements it using jinja

to run use `python run.py` it will start a Flask app on `127.0.0.1:5000` and when you redirect to it

the data that is being provided is in run.py thanks to jinja that we're able to perform such tasks too conveniently
